# Entry 1

Throughout these days we have had the oppurtunity to look for and explore different topics. Since, these topics had to be related to STEM, I statred to a few topics I had in mind. I did some research on the type of animals that are in danger because of human causes. This is related to zoology, the study of animanls and their enviornment, which is related to STEM. However, I also had another topic in mind, Thyroid Disease. 

Not alot of people know what Thyroid disease is. If I can find information and how to prvent it, it can be very helpful to people who can have this disease or trying to know more about this disease and how to prevent it. Currently, I have only reasearched information and written down some notes.
Up unitl now, I have learned to communnicate better by asking for people's opinion on my topic and what they think about it.
