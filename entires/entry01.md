# Entry 1

Throughout these days we have had the oppurtunity to look for and explore different topics. Since these topics had to be related to STEM, and I already had a few topics in mind, I decided to do some research on these topics. One of the topics was Zoology. Zoology is the study of the behavior, structure, physiology, classification, and distribuation of animals. However I wanted to find out ways we can prevent some animals from extinction because people all around the world might want to help these animals and they don't know how to and by providing information it would help them and benefit the animals. However, I also had another topic in mind which is the Thyroid Disease. 

Not alot of people know what the Thyroid Disease is. Thyorid Disease basically focuses on any dysfunction of the butterfly-shaped gland at the base of the neck(thyroid). There are two specific types of thyroid disease that I want to focus more on and do research on which are, Hypothyroidism and Hyperthyroidism. After doing some research on both of them, I found out that Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of the thyroid hormone. In hyperthyroidism, there is an overproduction of a hormone by the butterfly shapd gland in the neck. This is very immportant becasue the thyroid gland is a vital hormone and it plays a very immportant role in the metabolism, regulation of body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, growth and development of the human body.According to a website, about 60% of the people with some form of thyroid disease are unaware of this disease. When I read this I felt that if I pick this topic and do more research maybe I can help people who have this disease know what medications to take or how to cure their disease.

Currently, I have only reasearched information and written down some notes.
Up unitl now, I have learned how to communnicate better by asking for people's opinion on my topic.
