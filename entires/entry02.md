In my last blog, I said that I will be choosing to research more about thyroid disease. These past couple of weeks, I have been doing more research about this disease. I have been gathering more information related to my topic. I have been organizing it by simply putting it into bullet points which makes it a lot easier to read and find. The sources I’ve been using to gather more information are https://www.womenshealth.gov/, https://www.mayoclinic.org/, https://www.thyroid.org/hypothyroidism/, and https://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions. These sources have been very helpful by giving me an idea on how to organize my information even further. Since we have been learning how to synthesize information, we looked are our school website and our SEP website, to get an idea on how the information was separated into different topics or pages. When you look at a website, you don’t just see a huge block of text. Instead, what you see is the overview, subheadings, and sections.  They either take you to a different page or to another section of the page. There is also a main page or home page in websites. These ways of separating information into different sections make it easier for any person looking at the website to find a specific thing they’re trying to look for. In order to be able to do the same thing with the information I gathered, I had to first learn what the word synthesize means. When you synthesize information, which is what authors of books have to do to make a book, you are taking this huge block of text and you’re basically breaking it up into chunks or separate sections so it would be easier for you to make a book or in this case, a website. After practicing with our teacher’s research about Down Syndrome, we then got to look at the way he synthesized his notes and practiced it with our research notes. It made it easier to visualize how our website might look like, how it would be split up into different sections and what pages it would have. 

Currently in the Engineering Design Process, I am technically still in the researching and gathering information process. Every week we keep adding on to the information we have and making sure that everything we have is accurate. We also make sure that it’s synthesized enough for us to understand so that when we will start making our website, the information is not all over the place. 

The skills I have picked up during these few weeks, are how to read and how to really organize information. I have looked at many websites where there is so much information that I don’t even know where to start, but when I read through it, I try my best to comprehend it and put it in my own words. I also learned how to really organize information which is pretty much what we have been working on the past few weeks. I learned how to synthesize our information and make it understandable, and not just a huge chunk of text about a topic.
